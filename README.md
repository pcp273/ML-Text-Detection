# ML-Text-Detection
Copycat Team

These Python files use an API service to detect text from an image, convert the image into string data type, and then upload the results into a text file. 

OCR and Tesseract (Google's) are both two different API services, but both does the same job. OCR API does a better job at reading the image into text. 

"screenshot.png" is the image used to be converted into text values.
